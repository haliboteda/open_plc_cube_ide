"""The .cproject linker-script option must stay a variable, not a filename.

Case P17. $PROD/docs/engineering/HOW-TO-RUN-TESTS.md holds the criterion; run by ctest (tests/CMakeLists.txt),
$PROD/docs/build/CUBEMX-RULES.md the background.

CubeMX writes a hardcoded STM32H743IIKX_FLASH.ld into that option on every
generation. Hardcoded, the port-tool build's `-E PLC_LD_SCRIPT=...` has nothing
to act on and that image silently loses its 2048K script. tools/restore_ld_script.bat
undoes it after generation, but that depends on CubeMX running the script after
it writes .cproject -- an ordering ST controls. This check is what catches the
day that ordering changes.

Exit code is the verdict: 0 the option is the variable, 1 it is not.
