"""Turning the I-cache off must be undone on every path out of the function.

Case P16, evidence for R1-25 (a failed upload must not damage the installed
app). $PROD/docs/engineering/HOW-TO-RUN-TESTS.md holds the criterion; run by ctest (tests/CMakeLists.txt).

Flash_If_Write() disables the I-cache and unlocks the flash, then writes in a
loop. Returning straight out of that loop on the first bad word skips both
HAL_FLASH_Lock() and SCB_EnableICache(): the flash stays UNLOCKED for the rest
of the run, so any later stray write can reach the installed app. That is the
requirement this defends, and it is a property of every exit path -- forcing one
failing write only exercises one of them, which is why this is a source check
and not a board case.

The rule, per SCB_DisableICache() site:

  * a matching SCB_EnableICache() must follow in the same function;
  * no `return` may sit between the two;
  * HAL_FLASH_Lock() must come before the re-enable, when the function locks at
    all (the erase and write paths both do).

EXEMPT names a site that disables the cache and deliberately never re-enables.
It is a list, not a silent skip: a new one has to be argued for here.

Exit code is the verdict: 0 every site restores what it turned off, 1 one does not.
