# IAP Bootloader Host Test

Case **T1-16**. Runs the *real* bootloader certificate and auth source
(`open_plc_cube_ide/IAPServer/`: `sha256.c`, `iap_keyderive.c`, `iap_cert.c`,
`fw_verify.c` + the vendored micro-ecc, `iap_auth.c`, `net_rand.c`) natively on a PC against
a fake STM32 HAL and a fake owner slot (`stubs/`), instead of only being
testable by flashing real hardware.

Out of scope on purpose: `IAP_server.c`'s command parser and the USB/TCP/Flash
stack it needs. This harness covers the certificate/auth core.

## Build & run

Part of the `tests/` CMake project; the ctest entry is `T1-16`. How to run:
`tests/README.md`. The binary exits `0` iff every check passes.

## What's checked

- `sha256_selftest()` — the crypto primitives against FIPS 180-4 vectors.
- Certificate layout: 132 bytes, `leaf_pubkey` at 0, `serial` at 64 as a
  little-endian `uint32`, `root_sig` at 68, no padding.
- `iap_cert_verify()` accepts a certificate its root signed — delegated and
  self-signed alike — and rejects one signed by any other root.
- Tampering with `leaf_pubkey`, `serial`, or `root_sig` breaks verification.
- `iap_cert_verify_image()` needs **both** halves: an uncertified leaf is
  rejected even when it really did sign the image, and a certified leaf does
  not vouch for an image somebody else signed.
- Changing the trusted root retroactively invalidates firmware certified by
  the old one — the property that makes `setowner` mean anything.
- A full challenge-response: the nonce is the 16 bytes the RNG handed over (the
  stub is told which, so the golden signature still applies), acceptance, replay
  rejection, expiry past `IAP_AUTH_NONCE_TTL_MS`, an answer with no challenge
  behind it, an uncertified signer, and a certified certificate carrying
  somebody else's signature.
- An RNG that cannot deliver issues no challenge at all, and leaves no earlier
  nonce still accepting answers.
- `net_rand_seed()` seeds `rand()` with the RNG word, so lwIP's `LWIP_RAND()`
  differs per boot and per board; a failed RNG leaves `rand()` untouched.
- `net_rand_tcp_isn()` returns the RNG word, and falls back to `rand()` when the
  RNG fails (decision 67).

## The golden vectors

Every certificate and signature in `golden_vectors.h` was produced by the
**shipping PC tool** (`IAPTool cert` / `signraw` / `genkey`), not by a second
implementation written for the test. A passing T1-16 therefore means the
bootloader's C code and the Go tool agree on the wire format, rather than each
being internally consistent.

Regenerate only when the wire format changes — the certificate layout, what
the root signature covers, or the nonce construction. The generator needs the
shipping IAPTool, so it lives with the contract tests in `OpenPLC_Test`, which
regenerates into a scratch directory and fails when this file differs
(decision 78; it never writes here). Update this file from that output.

Never hand-edit `golden_vectors.h`. The keys used to make it are temporary and
are deleted with the run.
